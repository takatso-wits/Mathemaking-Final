    <!--Alphie Combinations: Start-->
    <string name="alphi_introduction">In Alphie Combinations, the elements are not viewed as numbers,
	"\n"rather as digits which can be permuted within that digital context
	"\n"until there are no other ways of permuting such elements of the digital value in question:
    "\n\n"Example:"\n"
	Value 23 can be digitally permuted as 23 and(or) 32 which does not make 23, as a numeric, equal to 32.
	However, 23 and 32 are both digitally equal in the context of this concept. That is, 23 both digitally
	translate to 2+3 and 3+2 which yields the same digital value of 5.
        "\n"It means that, though 23 is not equal to 32 in terms of the actual numeric value, 23 is equal to 32 in the
		digital context notation of this study. So 23 and 32 -> 2+3 = 5 and 3+2 = 5, either way.
    This digital concept holds water if we do away with placeholder notation - meaning that in a number like 23,
		both 2 and 3 are treated as though they occupy the same place value (both tens and units).
    This allows, therefore, for unrestricted rearrangments of digits without fear of breaching the placeholder notation
	principle, which then, implicates this study as distinguished from conventional procedures."\n\n"</string>
